                    â€œThe traditional health care system of today can be confusing and fragmented. Our passion is knowing

                    their care from start to finish. And that ability to coordinate, comfort, and personalize their
                    care, and seeing their gratification in the processâ€¦is what I love most about what I do!" ---- Jami
